# ML-and-Analysis-of-my-Spotify-tracks-audio-features

[Please note, the functions used in the API to retrieve data are now deprecated, so therefore consult the notebooks for a clearer insight into the process followed.]

Using the Spotify Developper API, I am looking for trends of my listening habits and preferences through audio features analysis.

I really like music. I am the kind of person that curates about 100 different playlists for each mood and sub-mood, and brags about listening to everything. In an attempt to better curate them, I decided to explore my songs meta data and audio features.

ðŸŽ¯The first notebook details how I downloaded the required data from the Spotify API. 
ðŸŽ¯The second one conducts a thorough analysis of this data through histograms, bar plots, radar charts and wordclouds. This has provided great insights into my listening trends and also revealed some possible errors in Spotify's gathered audio features. This notebook is updated as soon as I think of something new. 

ðŸŽ¯Based on the second notebook, I noticed an opportunity to perform clustering based on songs' audio features. This is conducted in a third notebook. Once this is done, clusters are analysed and interpreted to see if they correspond to specific genre, if the clusters are all about the same size or not, and if some of my favourite songs, gathered from one of my personal playlists and the On Repeat Spotify playlist, tend to fall in one specific cluster.

This is one of the project I've had the most fun doing so I hope you enjoy it!âœ¨
