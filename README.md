# ML-and-Analysis-of-my-Spotify-tracks-audio-features

Using the Spotify Developper API, I am looking for trends of what I like in my songs through audio features analysis.

I LOVE music. I am that friend with 100 different playlists for each mood and sub-mood, that brags about listening to everything. Naturally, I wait eagerly for my Spotify Wrapped to be available, only to be left...underwhelmed. Sometimes it feels like it is incomplete or just maybe incorrect. I then decided to test if, as I like to believe, I do have way more various taste in songs that shown by analysing my songs' audio features myself.

The first notebook details how I downloaded the required data from the Spotify API. The second one conducts a thorough analysis of this data through histograms, bar plots, radar charts and wordclouds. This has provided great insights into my listening trends and also revealed some possible errors in Spotify's gathered audio features. This notebook is updated as soon as I think of something new. Based on the second notebook, I noticed an opportunity to perform clustering based on songs' audio features. This is conducted in a third notebook. Once this is done, clusters are analysed and interpreted to see if they correspond to specific genre, if the clusters are all about the same size or not, and if some of my favourite songs, gathered from one of my personal playlists and the On Repeat Spotify playlist, tend to fall in one specific cluster.

This is one of the project I've had the most fun doing so I hope you enjoy it!
